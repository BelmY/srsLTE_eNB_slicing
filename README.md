====================================
[![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/10045/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/10045)

srsLTE is a free and open-source LTE software suite developed by SRS (www.softwareradiosystems.com). 

This is a modified version of [srsLTE] (https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE) that includes slicing support in the eNB.

It includes:
  * **srsENB**
    * Modified version of the eNB to support the usage of different configuration for S1-C and S1-U and hence, enabling the usage of OpenAirCN.
    * Added new functionality that enables the usage of slicing in the UE.

srsLTE is released under the AGPLv3 license and uses software from the OpenLTE project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlte) for some security functions and for RRC/NAS message parsing.

More information provided in the official srsLTE repository [srsLTE repo] (https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE)
