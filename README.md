srsLTE is a free and open-source LTE software suite developed by SRS (www.softwareradiosystems.com). 

It includes:
  * srsENB - Modified version of the eNB to support the usage of different configuration for S1-C and S1-U and hence, enabling the usage of OpenAirCN.

srsLTE is released under the AGPLv3 license and uses software from the OpenLTE project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/openlte) for some security functions and for RRC/NAS message parsing.
